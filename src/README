The following files have been changed on October 29, 2001:

coordinates.F90: the ga-definition for ord_type=3 is commented out because it
                 seems not to be used.

internal_pressure.F90: There is now a compiler option for the new 
                       scheme of Song and Wright 1998. It is switched on for
		       pressure gradient evaluation in sigma-coordinates
		       (-DPRESS_GRAD_Z NOT defined).

uu_mommentum.F90,vv_mommentum.F90,mommentum.F90: new Coriolis averaging of
                      Espelid et al. 2000 used, switched on with -DNEW_CORI.
		      When -DNEW_CORI is not set, simply the avarage
		      transports are used.

                      In momentum.F90, the slow term for bottom friction does
		      now always absorb energy.

bottom_friction_3d.F90: Averaging of bottom velocities changed.

m3d.F90: Also in init_3d, start_macro is called before coordinates. 
         This is a must, because otherwise ssvn etc are zero.

uv_diffusion.F90: Here I have written some lines which are however
                  commented out. They should stay there for the first.
