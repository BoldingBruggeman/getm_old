Initial version developed by Hans Burchard in the Matar MAST project.
The original code was not very generel and in order to apply it for 
a different area quite a lot should be changed.

Shortly after Karsten Bolding started at JRC we decided to join forces
and turn the original code into a generel purpuse 3D model. The first 
step was to remove all non-generel code from the original code. Second 
step was to implement generel input-output routines. We decided to use
NETCDF as file format. Third step was to implement baroclinic effects.
In late July 1998 the first beta was ready - still with some missing
features - and was run for different simple test cases.
